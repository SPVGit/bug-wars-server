# BUG-WARS-SERVER

This is a full stack two player card game which uses React, Express, Node and MongoDB to carry out CRUD operations. Styling was carried out using CSS and Bootstrap. The app features Google and Facebook log in aside from the regular sign up and log in, as well as a password reset link which is emailed to the user via Nodemailer. It uses Socket.io for players to send their chosen card(s) over a chat box as well as to notify them when you have sent them a card. Local storage has been used for actions to persist between page refreshes. Account details can be edited and profile pictures can be updated by the help of Cloudinary.
